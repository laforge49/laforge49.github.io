Projects Overview

<h1>Projects Overview</h1>
<p>I've got too many projects, many of them quite old.
So here are some notes to help you out.</p>

  <h3>JActor2 - A Robust Alternative to Threads and Locks</h3>
  <div>
<p>
JActor2 is a multi-threaded OO programming model, 
inspired by Alan Kay's early thoughts on Objects. 
JActor2 is based on asynchronous 2-way messaging with assured responses. 
The net result being code that is both simpler and more robust, and hence easier to maintain.

  <h3>JActor-Modules - Adds Modularity to JActor2</h3>

  <h3>utils - Advanced Java Utilty Classes</h3>
  <div>
<p>
Here are some helpful classes that you may not find elsewhere.

</h4>
<p>
How do you write a cache that can be used across multiple threads?
The class java.util.LinkedHashMap is a pretty good cache, but it is not thread safe.
And adding a bunch of synchronization locks might not be the fastest way to handle caching in a thread-safe way.
</p>
<p>
The solution provided here is to have a separate cache for each thread for maintaining hard links to a minimum number of references, 
but to track all cache entries in a concurrent
weak-valued hash map. If any cache has an entry for a given key, 
then the concurrent hash map will have a weak reference to that entry with the same key.
Retrieval then is made against the concurrent hash map while updating the thread's cache to track references accessed by that thread. 
</p>
<p>
The code is lock-free and high performance.

</h4>
<p>
Need to work with a collection of weak references? These can become quite large at times if you are depending on a 
reference queue for removing empty references because gc may be slow to detect otherwise unreachable references.
This means that you probably should not use a hash map to hold a weak references collection as a hash map only scales up, never down.
The ConcurrentWeakValueMap addresses these issues for you.
