<h1>Project Metadata</h1>
<p>I've got too many projects, many of them quite old.
So here are some notes to help you out.</p>
<h2>
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/agilewikidevelopers">AgileWikiDevelopers</a>
</h2>
<p>
A Google Group that you are free to join,
AgileWikiDevelopers covers a number of advanced topics, 
as well as being a place for me to chat about 
what I am working on.

<a href="https://github.com/laforge49/JActor2">JActor2</a>
</h2>
<p>
JActor2 is a multi-threaded OO programming model, 
inspired by Alan Kay's early thoughts on Objects. 
JActor2 is based on asynchronous 2-way messaging with assured responses. 
The net result being code that is both simpler and more robust, and hence easier to maintain.
</p>
<p>
Getting close to a 1.0 release.
</p>
<h2>
<a href="https://github.com/laforge49/util">util</a>
</h2>
<p>
A brand new project for various Java utility classes.
</p>
<h2>
<a href="https://github.com/laforge49?tab=repositories">Other Projects</a>
</h2>
<p>
I have not listed all of the projects above. Some are quite old, others moderately current.
