<h1>Project Metadata</h1>
<p>I've got too many projects, many of them quite old.
So here are some notes to help you out.</p>

A Google Group that you are free to join,
AgileWikiDevelopers covers a number of advanced topics, 
as well as being a place for me to chat about 
what I am working on.

</h2>
<p>
JActor2 is a multi-threaded OO programming model, 
inspired by Alan Kay's early thoughts on Objects. 
JActor2 is based on asynchronous 2-way messaging with assured responses. 
The net result being code that is both simpler and more robust, and hence easier to maintain.
</p>
<p>
Getting close to a 1.0 release.

<a href="projects/utils/index.html">utils</a>
</h2>
<p>
A brand new project for various Java utility classes.
</p>
<h3>
<a href="http://laforge49.github.io/projects/utils/0.1.0/api/index.html?org/agilewiki/utils/cache/package-summary.html">org.agilewiki.utils.cache</a>
</h3>
<p>
How do you write a cache that can be used across multiple threads?
The class java.util.LinkedHashMap is a pretty good cache, but it is not thread safe.
And adding a bunch of synchronization locks might not be the fastest way to handle caching in a thread-safe way.
</p>
<p>
The solution provided here is to have a separate cache for each thread for maintaining hard links to a minimum number of references, 
but to track all cache entries in a concurrent
weak-valued hash map. If any cache has an entry for a given key, 
then the concurrent hash map will have a weak reference to that entry with the same key.
Retrieval then is made against the concurrent hash map while updating the thread's cache to track references accessed by that thread. 
</p>
<p>
The code is lock-free and high performance.
